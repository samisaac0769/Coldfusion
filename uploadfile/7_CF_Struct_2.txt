ColdFusion Structure
--------------------

Create a web page that will have two text boxes and a submit button. When submitted, the page will post to self

Create a structure in ColdFusion with the values from the text box. The text entered in text box one is the key, and the text entered in text box 2 is the value. Each time you submit the form, the values entered previously should also be shown. 

	It means, if I submit a form with 'ColdFusion', 'super', then I should see a dump with key as 'ColdFusion' & value as 'Super'.
	Now, If I enter 'php', 'good', then I should see both ColdFusion, php on the screen along with their values

CFDUMP the structure.
