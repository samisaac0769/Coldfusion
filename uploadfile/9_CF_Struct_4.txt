ColdFusion Structure
--------------------

Create a web page that will have two text boxes and a submit button. When submitted, the page will post to self

Create a structure in ColdFusion with the values from the text box. The text entered in text box one is the key, and the text entered in text box 2 is the value.
 Each time you submit the form, 
the values entered previously should also maintained in the structure.
	It means, if I submit a form with 'ColdFusion', 'super', then structure should have key as 'ColdFusion' & value as 'Super'.
	Now, If I enter 'php', 'good', then structure should have both ColdFusion, php along with their values


CFDUMP the structure. 

This is different from CF_Struct_3 task. If I enter ColdFusion and ColdFusion is already present, then the system should say, 
'ColdFusion already present. Cannot add again'
